Built a compiler for a made-up programming language and got perfect grade, University of Haifa, 31/1/2022

Supports data types, multi-dimensional arrays, for & while loops, objects with complex structures , functions and optimized memory management.

I've built a custom script (RunScript.bat) to run the input and open the output file, will require paths changes if run on a different computer

Uploaded perfect input & output files to give an idea around the programming language used.

Different versions of the compiler were uploaded with inputs and outputs files that fit the stage of the compiler development, ast.h and main.cpp must both exist in path_to_mcomp file before running the compiler on the input specified in the RunScript.bat script
