Built a compiler for a made-up programming language and got perfect grade, University of Haifa, 31/1/2022
I've built a custom script (RunScript.bat) to run the input and open the output file, will require paths changes if run on a different computer
Uploaded perfect input & output files to give an idea around the programming language used.
