# TheoryCompilation

Built a compiler for a Pascal-like programming language with support for multiple data types, multi-dimensional arrays, conditional statements, loops, functions, complex object structures, scope management, and memory management. Utilized debugging tools to trace and monitor every function call, ensuring accurate execution and optimization of the compilation process.

I've built a custom script (RunScript.bat) to run the input and open the output file, please edit the .bat file and change paths accordingly
Uploaded perfect input & output files to give an idea around the programming language used.

Different versions of the compiler were uploaded with inputs and outputs files that fit the stage of the compiler development, ast.h and main.cpp must both exist in path_to_mcomp file before running the compiler on the input specified in the RunScript.bat script
